    <h1>About me.</h1>

    <p> My name is Max Ryland and this is my first ever website. <br>

        <br>
       
        I have built this website for my Data Science module as part of my Bsc in Economics and Politics at the University of Bristol. <br>
       

        <br>
        Building this website has been an enjoyable yet challenging task which has tought me valuable skills.   <br>

        <br>


        I am a keen sportsman which is why I decided to base my project on the Economics of the Olympics. <br> 
        
        <br>
        My project looks into the relationship between Team GBs funding and medal count for each sport. Specifically, we look at whether funding and medals are positively correlated and which sporting event and Olympic Games has the highest return on investment.
            </p>
