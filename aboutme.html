    <p> My name is Max Ryland and this is my first ever website. <br>

        <br>
       
        I have built this website for my Data Science module as part of my Bsc in Economics and Politics at the University of Bristol. <br>
       

        <br>
        Building this website has been an enjoyable yet challenging task which has taught me valuable skills.   <br>

        <br>


        I am a keen sportsman and football fan which is why I decided to base <a class="textLink" href="project" style="color: #f4c245" >my project</a> on the Economics of the the World Cup. <br> 
        
        <br>
        My project looks into the impact that major footballing events, such as the World Cup, has on stock markets. 
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Specifically, we look at the effects that particular matches as well as the World Cup as a whole have on individual stocks, on trading volumes, and on national indexes.
