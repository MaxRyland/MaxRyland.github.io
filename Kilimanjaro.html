        Three years on and two cancelations later, this summer I have finally set off on my Kilimqnjqro adventure!  <br>
       

        <br>
        This 6 day hike trekking up to the 'roof of Africa' has been the experience of a lifetime made all the more incredible by the fantastic group 
        of people I was sharing this trip with.  <br>
        
        <br> I would like to thank everyone who made this possible by donating to the fantastic Hope for Children charity. 
        Speaking to the guides and porters, your donations are greatly appreciated and go a long way to helping children and many families live happier
        healthier lives. <br>
        
        <br>

        As promised, here are some pictures from my time climbimg Mt. Kilimajaro!
