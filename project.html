    There is a general consensus that economic prosperity is thought to improve the health of a country.
    Indeed, citizens of richer countries typically suffer less from diseases and illnesses, and 
    live longer lives. </p>

<p> <br>
    The chart on the right shows the relationship between economic prosperity and longevity of a population. 
    We see that GDP per capita is positively correlated with life expectancy at birth among OECD countries. 
    For every 10.000 dollar increase in GDP per capita life expectancy at birth increases by 0.7 years. </p>

<p> <br> 
    Furthermore, we see from the below chart that the top 3 healthiest countries in the world, 
    according to the Bloomberg Health Index, are highly developed economies with high GDP/capita levels. 
    Whilst the 3 least healthiest countries are poorer, less developed nations. </p>

    <br> 

    <div class="chart3" id="secondChart">
        <script>
         var myChart2 = "ProjectG2.json";
          vegaEmbed('#secondChart', myChart2);
          </script>
    </div>
    
<p> <br> <br> <br> 
    While economic prosperity undeniably leads to longer and healthier lives, the aim of this project
    is to go beyond this main wisdom and examine <strong> how exactly does economic prosperity 
    cause good health.</strong>  
</p>

<p> <br>  
    The first channel of interest that we will explore is how economic prosperity may affect
    the supply side of health. Indeed, the fruits of economic growth would allow 
    governments to increase spending on public health services.
</p>

<p> <br>
    We can observe this mechanism from the below chart. As world GDP per capita has 
    increased over the course of the 21st century so too has health expenditure per capita. 
    In fact, both measures seem to increase in tandem, as GDP and Health spending have roughly 
    doubled since 2000.
</p>

 <div class="chart2" id="thirdChart">
    <script>
     var myChart3 = "ProjectG3.json";
      vegaEmbed('#thirdChart', myChart3);
      </script>
  </div> 

<br> <br> <br>

<p> <br> <br> <br>
    Health spending increases are the result of economic growth. Additional health spending allows 
    national health services to invest in human and physsical capital which improves the country’s supply 
    of health and, by definition, the quality of overall health.
</p>

<p> <br>
    We consider this theory by studying South Korea’s supply of healthcare. South Korea has undergone 
    incredible economic growth in the last half century, averaging a 6.34% annual GDP growth rate since
    1990, during which the country has transitioned from a developing to a developed country.
    As expected, South Korea’s healthcare provision has significantly improved alongside 
    its economic prosperity. 
</p>

<div class="chart3" id="fourthChart">
    <script>
     var myChart4 = "ProjectG4.json";
      vegaEmbed('#fourthChart', myChart4);
      </script>
  </div> 

  <p> <br>
    We see vast improvements to healthcare resources in South Korea. The number of hospital
    beds available have more than tripled and CT scanners and MRI units, which help physicians diagnose
    a range of conditions by producing images of internal organs and structures of the body, have 
    increased twofold and sixfold, respectively. The numbers of nurses and doctors have also doubled 
    in the last 20 years. 
</p>

<p> <br>
    In sum, economic prosperity improves health through increased spending on healthcare.
