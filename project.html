    There is a general consensus that economic prosperity is thought to improve the health of a country.
    Indeed, citizens of richer countries typically suffer less from diseases and illnesses, and 
    live longer lives. </p>

<p> <br>
    The chart on the right shows the relationship between economic prosperity and longevity of a population. 
    We see that GDP per capita is positively correlated with life expectancy at birth among OECD countries. 
    For every 10.000 dollar increase in GDP per capita life expectancy at birth increases by 0.7 years. </p>

<p> <br> 
    Furthermore, we see from the below chart that the top 3 healthiest OECD countries, 
    according to the Bloomberg Health Index, are highly developed economies with high GDP/capita levels. 
    Whilst the 3 least healthiest countries are poorer, less developed nations. </p>

    <br> 
    
    <!--CHART 2-->
    <div class="chart3" id="secondChart">
        <script>
         var myChart2 = "ProjectG2.json";
          vegaEmbed('#secondChart', myChart2);
          </script>
    </div>
    
<p> <br> <br> <br> 
    While economic prosperity undeniably leads to longer and healthier lives, the aim of this project
    is to go beyond this main wisdom and examine <strong> how exactly does economic prosperity 
    cause good health.</strong>  
</p>

<p> <br>  
    The first channel of interest that we will explore is how economic prosperity may affect
    the supply side of health. Indeed, the fruits of economic growth would allow 
    governments to increase spending on public health services.
</p>

<p> <br>
    We can observe this mechanism from the below chart. As world GDP per capita has 
    increased over the course of the 21st century so too has health expenditure per capita. 
    In fact, both measures seem to increase in tandem, as GDP and Health spending have roughly 
    doubled since 2000.
</p>

    <!--CHART 3-->
 <div class="chart2" id="thirdChart">
    <script>
     var myChart3 = "ProjectG3.json";
      vegaEmbed('#thirdChart', myChart3);
      </script>
  </div> 

<br> <br> <br>

<p> <br> <br> <br>
    Health spending increases are the result of economic growth. Additional health spending allows 
    national health services to invest in human and physical capital which improves the country’s supply 
    of health and, by definition, the quality of overall health.
</p>

<p> <br>
    We consider this theory by studying South Korea’s supply of healthcare. South Korea has undergone 
    incredible economic growth in the last half century, averaging a 6.34% annual GDP growth rate since
    1990, during which the country has transitioned from a developing to a developed country.
    As expected, South Korea’s healthcare provision has significantly improved alongside 
    its economic prosperity. 
</p>

<br> <br> <br>
    
   
 <!--CHART 4-->
<div class="chart3" id="fourthChart">
    <script>
     var myChart4 = "ProjectG4.json";
      vegaEmbed('#fourthChart', myChart4);
      </script>
  </div> 

  <p> <br>
    We see vast improvements to healthcare resources in South Korea. The number of hospital
    beds available have more than tripled and CT scanners and MRI units, which help physicians diagnose
    a range of conditions by producing images of internal organs and structures of the body, have 
    increased twofold and sixfold, respectively. The numbers of nurses and doctors have also doubled 
    in the last 20 years. 
</p>

<p> <br>
    In sum, economic prosperity improves health through increased spending on healthcare.
</p>
    
    <!--CHART 5-->
    <div class="chart2" id="fifthChart">
    <script>
     var myChart5 = "ProjectG5.json";
      vegaEmbed('#fifthChart', myChart5);
      </script>
  </div> 
 
  <p> <br> <br> <br> <br>  <br> <br>
    The second channel through which economic growth contributes to better health is through better
    nutrition. The theory goes that economic prosperity increases incomes which in turn increases the
    consumption of calories and micronutrients. Well-nourished individuals are in turn in a better
    position to resist bacterial diseases and have better prospects to recover from illnesses. This 
    is particularly beneficial for better health outcomes in developing countries.
</p>

<p> <br> 
    As malnutrition is particularly widespread throughout the African continent,  we will test 
    this theory by studying the continent’s fastest growing economies; Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, 
    Nigeria, Ghana. Chart 5 shows these countries have had tremendous growth over the last  
    two decades.
</p>

<br> <br> <br>

    <!--CHART 6-->
<div class="chart3" id="sixthChart">
    <script>
     var myChart6 = "ProjectG6.json";
      vegaEmbed('#sixthChart', myChart6);
      </script>
  </div> 

<p> <br> <br> <br>
    Stunting, or growth retardation, is the result of long-term nutritional deprivation and has severe consequences 
    on long-term health, putting the individual at greater risk of illness and death. 
</p>

<p> <br>
    Also, small women are at greater risk of delivering an infant with low birth weight, 
    contributing to the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition, as infants of low birth weight 
    tend be smaller as adults.
</p>

<p> <br>
    There is general trend of decreasing malnutrition among the fast growing economies of Africa, 
    supporting the previously outlined theory. The prevalence of stunting of under 5 year olds has 
    significantly diminished in the time frame of these country's economic prosperity.
</p>

  <br> <br> <br>
    
    
    <!--CHART 7-->
  <div class="chart2" id="seventhChart">
    <script>
     var myChart7 = "ProjectG7.json";
      vegaEmbed('#seventhChart', myChart7);
      </script>
  </div> 

<br> <br> <br> <br>

<p> <br>  While other factors also affect health, it is reasonable to suggest that 
    economic prosperity positively impacts food provision and thus population health in developing countries.

<br> <br> <br>

To conclusion, through the means of improved governmental health provision and better nutrition, we have 
shown how economic prosperity delivers better health outcomes. Life expectancy in South Korea and the selected 
African countries has considerably improved during the last two decades of economic prosperity.
